Live demo: https://lhary-real-estate.vercel.app

This Real Estate website was built with NextJS and is hosted on Vercel. It is a frontend project with a firebase backend.

I made use of Bayut API from RapidAPI for all of the property data and Firebase for user authentication so users can sign-up and sign-in to their account with an email address in order to save their properties to their wishlist.

I made use of Firestore which is cloud storage of firebase to save data, with this users will be able to store/save specific data(property) from the frontend by clicking the heart icon.

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS
